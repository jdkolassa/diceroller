# DiceRoller

A simple program to run dice rolling operations from the command line, or (hopefully in the future) from an API.

The real intent behind this was to play around with coding concepts and learn some fundamentals, in order to sharpen my own coding skills and learn some concepts I haven't used before, like unit testing. In no way do I intend to take away from far better built random number generators. 

Inspired by [KreativeKorp's dX roller](https://www.kreativekorp.com/dX/) which has an API and is in turn based on the random number generation from [random.org/](https://www.random.org/). In no way is this going to be as random as that. 

## Technologies
- Typescript: For reducing errors, ensuring clean, high quality code, and speeding up development time.
- [MochaJS](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha): For testing. I haven't used unit testing previously, so this library will quite possibly change.
- [MathJS](https://github.com/josdejong/mathjs): For the random number generation and other math functions. The built-in Javascript [Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) object is just insufficient for my needs.
